Arduboy
=======
This library provides Arduboy's  core functionality.

## Using the Library
To use the Arduboy library, it must be installed and then included in your project.

### Install
Install the library by cloning its repository.
```	
$ git clone https://github.com/Arduboy/Arduboy.git
```

#### Where to Install

The library should be installed into your user's home Arduino `libraries` directory. Refer to the following list for the location of the Arduino `libraries` folder.

**Linux**
```
/home/username/Documents/Arduino/libraries
```
**Mac**
```
/Users/username/Documents/Arduino/libraries
```
**Windows**
```
C:\Users\username\My Documents\Arduino\libraries
```

### Include
To use the Arduboy library in your own sketches, include the `Arduboy.h` header file. To do so, add the following line to the top of your `.ino` file.
```C
#include "Arduboy.h"
```

### Board Selection
Select the **Leonardo** board as the target platform.

### Examples
Example games and source can be found in the `examples` directory.

#### Playing Examples
Find and play an example by opening it through the Arduino IDE, compiling, and uploading the example to the Arduboy.
Examples can be found in the Arduino IDE in the navigation menu under, `File > Examples > Arduboy > Example_Name`.

### Sketches Already Including the Arduboy Library
Sketches that include copies of the Arduboy library may not compile if the Arduboy library has been installed system wide. In these cases the Arduino compiler will try and link the system Arduboy library source with the local header file, which can cause compilation errors if the local library source differs from the system's Arduboy source.

To compile sketches that have included copies of the Aruboy Library,

Remove the local `Arduboy.cpp` and `Arduboy.h` files and try recompiling. This will only work in some cases.

**OR**

Rename `Arduboy.h` to `CustomArduboy.h` (or a similar name) and add `#include "CustomArduboy.h"` to the `.ino` sketch file.
